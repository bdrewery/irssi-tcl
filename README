1. Requirements

To build/use the module you need:
- Irssi and Irssi development files
- glib2 and glib2 development files
- Tcl 8.5+ and Tcl 8.5+ development files

It's possible it will work with older Tcl versions, but I haven't tested. Nor
have I tested with higher than 8.5.* actually.

2. Building

Linux:
Run 'make'

FreeBSD:
Run 'make -f Makefile.FreeBSD'

Didn't work? If it fails, check the -I directories listed in the Makefile
actually exist. They may be at a different location on your system (such as in
/usr/local/include and /usr/local/lib). You will need to alter them until they
are all correct if they are not.

Building with debug (only really alters script/module paths right now):
make -e DEBUG=-DDEBUG

3. Installing

'make install' (or 'make -f Makefile.FreeBSD install')
This will place libtcl.so in ~/.irssi/modules and Tcl scripts into ~/.irssi/tcl

Alternatively you can manually copy libtcl.so where you would like it, but the
module will look in ~/.irssi/tcl for scripts.

4. Usage

To load the module:
/load tcl

To autoload the module:
echo "load tcl" >> ~/.irssi/startup

The scripts that are loaded automatically are placed in ~/.irssi/tcl/scripts.conf
Alternatively, a script in ~/.irssi/tcl/ can be loaded via
/tcl load_script name_of_script.tcl

5. Commands

Run a command in the Tcl interpreter:
/tcl <command ...>

Reload Tcl scripts:
/tcl reload

6. Examples

/tcl set a [expr 5+5]
13:53 -!- Tcl: Running /tcl: 'set a [expr 5+5]'
13:53 -!- Tcl: Result: 10

/tcl set a
13:53 -!- Tcl: Running /tcl: 'set a'
13:53 -!- Tcl: Result: 10

See the "tcl" section in /set for Tcl script settings.

7. Scripting

See scripting.txt

8. Using (edited) eggdrop scripts
