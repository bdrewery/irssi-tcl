1. Requirements

To build/use the module you need:
- Irssi and Irssi development files
- glib2 and glib2 development files
- Tcl 8.5+ and Tcl 8.5+ development files

It's possible it will work with older Tcl versions, but I haven't tested. Nor
have I tested with higher than 8.5.* actually.

2. Building

Linux:
Run 'make'

FreeBSD:
Run 'make -f Makefile.FreeBSD'

Didn't work? If it fails, check the -I directories listed in the Makefile
actually exist. They may be at a different location on your system (such as in
/usr/local/include and /usr/local/lib). You will need to alter them until they
are all correct if they are not.

3. Installing

'make install'
This will place libtcl.so in ~/.irssi/modules and Tcl scripts into ~/.irssi/tcl

Alternatively you can manually copy libtcl.so where you would like it, but the
module will look in ~/.irssi/tcl for scripts.

4. Usage

To load the module:
/load tcl

To autoload the module:
echo "load tcl" >> ~/.irssi/startup

5. Commands

Run a command in the Tcl interpreter:
/tcl <command ...>

Reload Tcl scripts:
/tcl reload

6. Examples

/tcl set a [expr 5+5]
13:53 -!- Tcl: Running /tcl: 'set a [expr 5+5]'
13:53 -!- Tcl: Result: 10

/tcl set a
13:53 -!- Tcl: Running /tcl: 'set a'
13:53 -!- Tcl: Result: 10

See the "tcl" section in /set for Tcl script settings.

7. Scripting

Additional commands available to the Tcl interpreter can be seen in the
TclCmdTable table in tcl_module.c, as well as in tcl/irssi.tcl

Notes on some commands:
- putchan & putserv are wrappers around putchan_raw/putserv_raw. They do some
  cleaning on strings sent such as removing newlines and tabs. If you don't need
  this cleanup, feel free to use the _raw versions
- putserv is similar to putchan except putchan will show in the Irssi UI (for
  public channels) the commands being sent to the server. putserv will not
  trigger any signals whereas putchan triggers the signal message pub_own
