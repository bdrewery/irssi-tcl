Additional commands available to the Tcl interpreter can be seen in the
TclCmdTable table in tcl_module.c, as well as in tcl/irssi.tcl

Notes on some commands:
- putchan & putserv are wrappers around putchan_raw/putserv_raw. They do some
  cleaning on strings sent such as removing newlines and tabs. If you don't need
  this cleanup, feel free to use the _raw versions
- putserv is similar to putchan except putchan will show in the Irssi UI (for
  public channels) the commands being sent to the server. putserv will not
  trigger any signals whereas putchan triggers the signal message pub_own
